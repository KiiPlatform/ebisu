## Building and executing Test

Test application can be built by following command:

```sh
make
```

After aht, you can get `testapp`. You can execute this `testapp` by
following command.

```
./testapp
```

You can do them once by
```
make test
```

You can tweak the `make test` behavior by environemnt vars:

- JUNIT : if defined, it will generate junit-sylte test report under `test-result` directory.

- MEMCHECK : if defined, run test under valgrind

- PLAIN_HTTP : if defined, use raw HTTP instead of HTTPS, useful for packet capturing.

- APP_ID : specify the app-id used for the test.

- DEFAULT_HOST : specify the API hostname used for the test.

## using non-defualt app
To run this test against the different app-id, you should preapare the followings,

- create a user with login name `test1` and password `1234`.

- create a app scope topic `test-topic`.

- upload and enable the following server code.

```
function echo(params, context) {
  return params.message;
}
```
